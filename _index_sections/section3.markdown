## Template Align

This service implements **template**-based image alignment for the task of extracting information from **structured formats**; *e.g., ID cards, passports, driving licenses, forms, etc.*. Given the fact that semantic meaning is assigned to each field based on its location in the document, it is important to align data to a known template before proceeding with steps such as OCR.
