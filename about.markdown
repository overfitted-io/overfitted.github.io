**overfitted.io** is a cloud-based platform which aims to present in-house research efforts and implementations of different solutions in the fields of: 
* Computer Vision
* Artificial Intelligence
* Deep Learning

The main objective is to provide accessible services in order to assist end-users, developers and businesses in tackling difficult problems and achieving competitive results.

## Usage
All services are hosted on our **cloud** infrastructure to ensure minimal implementation complexity and overhead. This permits any registered user to interact with any service through an active **internet connection** by **programatically** submitting data and awaiting results without having to perform computationally expensive operations or integrate large external modules into existing projects.

Each available service is hosted on a different subdomain (*e.g.: service-1.api.overfitted.io*) and documentation with regard to API interactions will be publicly available. A **request** is made to this endpoint and a **response** is synchronously returned when available.
 

## Registration

Registration is required to interact with the services exposed here. Each registered account receives an unique **API key** which must be included in any request made to a service. Besides the API key, each account starts with a number of **credits** (balance) which is consumed when services are used.

See the [Get Started](/get-started) section for more details on this.
